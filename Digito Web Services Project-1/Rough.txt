About

More than just a start-up, Chatur Chidiyaa is a voyage that started from a leisure trip to Nal-sarovar (a wet land bird sanctuary in Gujarat) as a classroom project to a series of serious exhibitions that tested the model’s genuineness. The team collaborates on sustainability and design thinking to generate ideas that use old materials to make new concepts with an icing of handmade touch. We are a synchronization of curious Creatives who love to work with materials and passionate Marketers who believe that good design is about good idea presented intact.
We have a vision of imbibing sustainability in business as it optimizes the resources in an ingenious way satisfying our present need and saving sufficiently for the future.

Design philosophy
Considering four pillars of a green business philosophy – product, process, place and people, it focuses on a design conscious handmade products made out of innocent (recycled, reused, up cycled) materials such as bamboo, fabric, clay, paper that appeals for a balance between Ecology and Human activities by providing an opportunity to prosper the financially under privileged and communities with mentally different people as Chatur Chidiyaa product makers.
It redefines the bridge between the effective ways of manufacturing and the human demand to live better with great products around. The users receive plenty of functional products with a tantalization to care about nature..
